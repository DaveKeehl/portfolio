<h2>Let me introduce myself.</h2>
<p>
	Hi, my name is Davide Ciulla and I’m a software engineer based in Ticino (southern Switzerland)
	with a particular interest for front-end web development and UI/UX design.
	<br />
	I started playing with web technologies and design in 2014, and I haven’t stopped ever since. Over
	the years, I constantly improved my skills and managed to learn some incredible technologies that have
	allowed me to create fresh and modern web applications.
	<br />
	In my free time I love playing videogames (Nintendo fanboy right here!), reading comic books, playing
	the guitar and listening to interesting podcasts about design, tech and space.
